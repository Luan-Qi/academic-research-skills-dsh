The user invoked `/ars-rebuttal-audit`. Call the `skill` tool with name `academic-paper` to load that skill (skip this step if it is already loaded in this session), then run the mode below. This wrapper is a pointer, not the instructions: the authoritative text for the mode is `academic-paper/SKILL.md`.

**Mode:** `rebuttal-audit` (skill `academic-paper`)

---

Trigger the `academic-paper` skill in `rebuttal-audit` mode. Requires BOTH the reviewer comments AND an existing rebuttal/response draft to evaluate. Produces an advisory QA report (per-comment coverage + gaps + risk flags). Does NOT generate a new response, and does NOT emit Schema 11 / Material Passport / verified status (standalone invocation runs outside the pipeline). Fidelity spectrum, low oversight.

If only reviewer comments are present (no draft yet), use `revision-coach` instead.

Resolve plugin resources (references/, agents/, templates/, scripts/, shared/) from this plugin's root directory, not from the paper project's working directory. If the skill or a required file cannot be loaded, report the loading failure and stop; do not substitute this command summary for the mode instructions.

Mode reference: `MODE_REGISTRY.md` § academic-paper.
Skill entry: `academic-paper/SKILL.md`.

Ported from the ARS Claude Code plugin (Imbad0202/academic-research-skills, v3.23.0, CC-BY-NC-4.0). The deterministic tooling these commands call (`scripts/`, `shared/`, `MODE_REGISTRY.md`) is bundled in this plugin.
